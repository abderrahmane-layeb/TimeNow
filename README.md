# TimeNow Landing Page

This project was created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Sass. The goal of this page is to provide a simple and visually appealing introduction to my Web development experience, highlighting my skills and expertise in this field.

## Features

- Responsive design: The page is designed to adapt to different screen sizes and devices, using Bootstrap's grid system and responsive utilities.

- Clean and modern layout: The page features a simple and attractive layout, with clear headings, subheadings, and call-to-action buttons.

- Custom styling with Sass: The page uses Sass to organize and customize the CSS code, with variables, mixins, and helpers for easier maintenance and scalability.

- Integration with Bootstrap: The page also leverages the power of Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript components, such as the navbar, jumbotron, cards, and modals.
